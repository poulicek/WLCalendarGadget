**News**

01-18-2016 - Hotfix released. In the previous version was implemented a download wrapper which extended support of calendar sources. However, the traffic has overloaded the server capacity and it started failing with response code 503\. In the hotfix the wrapper has been removed, which may cause troubles with some calendar sources, but in general should give better service reliability.

01-17-2016 - After almost three years I've reviewed the working state of the gadget and finally released it's final version. Lately there were issues with data dowload, thus it's highly recommended to update to this latest version. The gadget newly includes a Russian translation.

04-29-2013 - Next version is ready for release. It includes again some minor bug fixes based on your suggestions and introduces support of Polish language. Also the notification of the new version won't appear again once it's hidden. Stay tuned for this release!

04-14-2013 - Just released new version implementing some bug fixes, most importantly the repeating message of availability of the new version.

04-07-2013 - New version of the gadget brings many improvements. It improves the compatibility with calendar providers, repairs some bugs but most importantly it introduces a new updated look designed for big screens. It also orders the events according to dates. It is called Midnight 2, make sure you'll select it in the settings dialog of the gadget (if you are a new user, this theme is selected by default). Most of the improvements were made thanks to your suggestions and they are still highly welcomed. Thanks for keeping the project alive!
